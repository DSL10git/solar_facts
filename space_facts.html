    <!-- The Sun -->
    <h2 class="change_color">The Sun</h2>
    <p class="change_color">The sun is at the center of the solar system, it's 8 <strong>Light-minutes</strong> away from the earth. <br>It is a common misconception that the Sun is yellow, or orange or even red. However,<br> the Sun is essentially all colors mixed together, which appear to our eyes as white. <br> The mass of our sun is  1.9891x1030 kg = 4.384x1030 lb = 2.192x1027 tons,<br> or a mass 333,000 times that of the Earth. The radius of the Sun is 696,265,000 meters <br> = 696,265 km = 432,639 mi or a radius 109 times that of the Earth. <br> The volume of the Sun is so huge that it could hold over 1.3 million Earths. <br> The sun's surface is 1000 farenheit and the sun's core is a scorching 27 million farenheit. <br>Standing on the sun's surface for a <strong>nanosecond</strong> would be the same as putting your thinger <br> on a burning match for 1 second while standing on the core on the sun for a nanosecond would instantly burn you. <br> The sun is 4.6 billion years old and it takes 8 minutes and 30 seconds for light to travel from the sun to earth. <br>Our sun has a heartbeat, it has a cycle of activity that last about 11 years. <br>Sun spots are cool areas on the sun's surface but they sill super hot.<br> Every second the sun converts 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium. <br>Next, we will learn mercury(The planet, not chemical element)</p>

    <h2 class="change_color">Mercury</h2>
    <p class="change_color">Hopefully you did your test, you didn't cheat and you passed, if you did all of that then congrats, you have finished with the sun!</p>
    <h2 class="change_color">Golssary</h2> 
    <p class="change_color"><strong>Light-minute</strong> - A light-second is a unit of length useful in astronomy, telecommunications and relativistic physics. <br>It is defined as the distance that light travels in free space in one second, and is equal to exactly 299792458 meters <br>(approximately 983571055 ft or 186282 miles). <br><strong>Nanosecond</strong> - one billionth of a second.</p>
